- 👋 Hello I am konabrew and I am a novice c# programmer. I know basic loop iterations, and very basic syntax. 
- 
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to become a expert programmer. 
- 
- 🌱 I’m currently obtaining a BAC in programming and software development. Hopefully one day become a software architect. 
- 
- I enjoy gathering the requirments, and using the variety of UML diagrams. The use case diagram and the 
  class diagram (only ones I am familiar with at the moment). The prerequisites, requirements, 
  the design phase (that is were the UML diagram come into play), after all that is finished the modular programming can begin.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything.

- 📫 How to reach me, DM me on Facebook or instagram, Kainoa Paishon is my real name
